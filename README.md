# Deroplus-AstroBWTv3

This is the new version of deroplus, a DERO AstroBWT/v3 miner. Deroplus has around 60% boost over the official miner.

To use this miner just go to releases download the version for your platform and run the prebuilt scripts.

Some benchmarks (if you want to improve this list send me a message on discord Jonutz15#2650):
